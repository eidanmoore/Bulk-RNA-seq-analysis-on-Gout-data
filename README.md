# Bulk-RNA-seq-analysis-on-Gout-data
A short bulk RNA-seq analysis performed in R based on a class-provided gout dataset. Code is adapted and expanded to facilitate a basic RNA-seq workflow starting from DEseq2 data, including analysis such as volcano plots, PCA, immune cell deconvolution and heatmap creation.

Hiya, this is just a relatively straightforward project that aims to perform some basic, but useful analysis on a pre-existing gout transcript dataset. Although this is not my first project, it is my first repo made in github so forgive me for any transgressions I may commit.
